#  pes_linearfsr

## Introduction 
LFSRs (linear feedback shift registers) provide a simple means for generating nonsequential lists of numbers quickly on microcontrollers. Generating the pseudo-random numbers only requires a right-shift operation and an XOR operation.A LFSR is specified entirely by its polynomial.    

## Applications of LFSR 
* Uses as counters
* Uses in cryptography
* Uses in circuit testing
* Uses in digital broadcasting and communications
*  radio jamming systems

## Required tools
* iverilog -> Icarus Verilog is an open source Verilog compiler that supports the IEEE-1364 Verilog HDL including IEEE1364-2005 plus extensions.
> sudo apt-get install iverilog
* Yosys -> Yosys is a framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains.
* Gtkwave -> GTKWave is a fully featured GTK+ based wave viewer for Unix and Win32 which reads LXT, LXT2, VZT, FST, and GHW files as well as standard Verilog VCD/EVCD files and allows their viewing.
> sudo apt-get install gtkwave 

## Executing the project

> git clone

> cd pes_linearfsr

> iverilog pes_linearfsr.v pes_linearfsr_tb.v -o pes_linearfsr

> ./pes_linearfsr

> gtkwave pes_linearfsr.vcd

## Gate level synthesis(GLS)
 While performing GLS we use skywater 130 nm technology library files to import the cells from the library. Using those cells we then generate the netlist which would be a new .v file generated by 
 write_verilog command. With this file and the testbench we generated for the RTL simulation we would again get a new waveform for this GLS netlist. This waveform should match with our initial waveform, 
 infact waveforms if every stages of the flow should match the initial design waveform.

* Go to the directory where verilog file is present and open terminal
* invoke Yosys

# Physical design
## Installation of ngspice, magic and OpenLane
### ngspice
Download the tarball from https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ to a local directory

 > cd $HOME

 >  sudo apt-get install
 
 > libxaw7-dev tar -zxvf ngspice-41.tar.gz cd ngspice-41
 
 > mkdir release
 
 >  cd release
 
 >  ../configure  --with-x --with-readline=yes --disable-debug
 
 >  sudo make
 
 >  sudo make install

### magic
Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the 1980's at Berkeley by John Ousterhout, now famous primarily for writing the scripting interpreter language Tcl. Due largely in part to its liberal Berkeley 
open-source license, magic has remained popular with universities and small companies. The open-source license has allowed VLSI engineers with a bent toward programming to implement clever ideas and help magic 
stay abreast of fabrication technology. However, it is the well thought-out core algorithms which lend to magic the greatest part of its popularity. Magic is widely cited as being the easiest tool to use for 
circuit layout, even for people who ultimately rely on commercial tools for their product design flow.
Run following commands one by one to fulfill the system requirement.

>   sudo apt-get install m4

>   sudo apt-get install tcsh

>   sudo apt-get install csh

> sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

> sudo reboot 

# After reboot run
